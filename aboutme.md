Hi! I'm a technically minded software developer with expertise in Java, JavaScript, C#, and Python. Recently, I graduated from the University of Copenhagen with a master's degree in Computer Science. Before, I received my bachelor's degree in Computing with Upper Second Class Honours from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019.

I'm able to design, implement, and maintain large and complex programs or systems, subject to external quality and performance constraints. I'm also familiar with adapting and applying general mathematical models for analysis and classification of data. I have great skills in applying algorithmic machine learning models to solve practical problems. I'm broadly interested in multimodal data analytics and game physics simulations. I am currently living in Denmark, however I am open to working remotely or relocating to a workplace.

If my qualifications match your requirements, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
