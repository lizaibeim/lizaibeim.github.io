Hi, I am a PhD Student in the [Computer Science department at UCPH](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/researchers_hcc/?pure=en/persons/659783) working with Associate Professor [Daniel Spikol](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/709183). Before that, I received my MSc in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen and BSc in Information Technology from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I am interested in multimodal data analytics, human-computer interactions, social computing, computer-supported cooperative work, multimodal learning, and AI in learning analytics. I am skilled in designing, implementing, and maintaining IoT systems subject to external quality and performance constraints.
