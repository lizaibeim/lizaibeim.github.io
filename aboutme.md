title: ABOUT ME

---

Hi! I 'm a Software developer with expertise in Java, JavaScript, C#, and Python. MSc in Computer Science from the
University of Copenhagen. I'm able to design, implement, and maintain large and complex programs or systems, subject to
external quality and performance constraints. I am also familiar with adapting and applying general mathematical models for
analysis and classification of data. Passionate about multimodal data analytics and physics simulations. 

I'm actively open to work. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any job opportunities for which you believe I would be a good fit.
Thanks in advance.
