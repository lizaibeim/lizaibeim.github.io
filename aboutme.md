Hi, I am a PhD Student in the [Computer Science department at UCPH](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/vip/researchers_hcc/?pure=en/persons/659783) working with Associate Professor [Daniel Spikol](https://di.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/709183). I am interested in multimodal data analytics, human-computer interactions, computer-supported cooperative work, social computing, multimodal learning, and AI in learning analytics. I am skilled in designing, implementing, and maintaining IoT systems subject to external quality and performance constraints.
