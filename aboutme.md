Hi! I'm a Software developer with expertise in Java, JavaScript, C#, and Python. I'm able to design, implement, and maintain large and complex programs or systems, subject to external quality and performance constraints. I'm also familiar with adapting and applying general mathematical models for analysis and classification of data. I'm broadly interested in multimodal data analytics and game physics simulations. Besides, I'm also passionate about applying algorithmic machine learning models to solve practical problems.

I received my master degree in Computer Science from the University of Copenhagen recently and my bachelor degree in Computing with Upper Second Class Honours from the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2019.

I'm actively open to work. Please don't hesitate to get in touch with me if you have any job opportunities for which you believe I would be a good fit.
Thanks in advance.
